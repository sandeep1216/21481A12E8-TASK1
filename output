•One is still be able compare each variable with the other by 
comparing bars.•The graph below is called a line graph.  It shows how a variable 
evolves with respect to another variable.  In the line graph below, we 
show how GDP has evolved by year.

Yearly Total GDPWhen to use a Line Graph, Pie 
Chart, or Bar Graph?
We use the pie chart here to compare parts of a whole.  
In our example, we compared components of US GDP.
The line chart is useful when you want to show how a 
variable changes over time.  For our purposes, we used it 
show how GDP changed over time.
Bar graphs are good for comparing different groups of 
variables.  We used it to compare different components of US GDP.  We did the same with the pie chart; depending on your purposes you may choose to use a pie chart or a bar graph.xy

some sample data; plot the data with x on the x-axis and y on the y-axis.051015202530

slide.  Notice that this plot is a straight line meaning that a linear equation must have generated this data.
•What if the data is not generated by a linear equation?  We can 
fit the data using a linear regression and use that line as an approximation to the data.  Regressions are beyond the scope of this workshop.Example from Urban Affairs
What kind of bar graph is this?
Whose life expectancy has changed the most since 1925?
In 1925, about how much longer was a woman expected 
to live than a man?

Republicans and Independents the same?During what time period did the party affiliations have the most change?Example from Education
